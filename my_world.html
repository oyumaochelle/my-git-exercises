<h1><b>MY WORLD</b></h1>
<h2>This poem talks about my world. Just for html practice!</h2>
<pre class="poem"> 
    Sun-kissed plains stretch to meet the sky,
    A canvas painted, vibrant, high.
    Acacia dance in emerald hues,
    Where zebra stripes and giraffes muse.
    
    Laughter spills from children's play,
    Mango scents drift on the midday sway.
    Drums beat life across the land,
    A rhythm held in calloused hand.
    
    Starlight paints the vast expanse,
    A million stories in each glance.
    My world, a tapestry so grand,
    Woven with love, by sun and sand.</pre>
